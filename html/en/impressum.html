<h3> Disclaimer of liability </h3>
<u> Liability for Content </u>
<p> All contents of our website have been created with the greatest care and to the best of our knowledge. However, we are unable to guarantee the correctness, completeness and currency of the content. As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages under the general laws according to § 7 section 1 TMG. According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, we are not obligated as a service provider to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general laws remain unaffected.
</p>
<p> However, liability in this regard is only possible from the point in time at which we become aware of a concrete infringement. Upon becoming aware of the above-mentioned infringements, we will remove this content immediately. 
</p>
<u> Liability for external links </u>
<p> 
Our website contains links to external websites of third parties. We have no influence on the content of these directly or indirectly linked websites. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the correctness of the contents of the "external links". The respective providers or operators (authors) of the sites are responsible for the contents of the external links.
</p>
<p> The external links were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking and were free of illegal content at the time of linking. A constant review of the content of the external links is not possible without concrete evidence of a violation of the law. In the case of direct or indirect links to the websites of third parties that lie outside our area of responsibility, a liability obligation would only exist in the case where we become aware of the content and it would be technically possible and reasonable for us to prevent use in the case of illegal content.
</p>
<p> This disclaimer also applies to links and references set within the own internet presence " semester project Team B-2" by questioners, blog contributors, guests of the discussion forum. For illegal, incorrect or incomplete contents and especially for damages resulting from the use or non-use of such information, only the service provider of the page to which reference was made is liable, not the one who merely refers to the respective publication via links.
</p> 
<p> If we become aware of any infringements, we will remove the external links immediately.
